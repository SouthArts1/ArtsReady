          Note: This changes the date displayed on the billing page, but
          does not affect the actual date Authorize.Net will charge the
          organization. Use this only for organizations that haven't set
          up automatic payment, or to correct the date on the billing page
          if it's out of sync with Authorize.Net's records.
