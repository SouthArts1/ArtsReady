Dear <%= @user.name %>

<%= @requesting_organization.name %> would like to become Battle Buddies with your organization, <%= @target_organization.name %>.

Becoming Battle Buddies means that both organizations agree to help each other, however possible, should either of you experience a crisis. If called upon by a Buddy, your organization can offer up resources, act as a proxy representative, and share select internal documents through the ArtsReady Critical Stuff feature. You can then expect your Buddy to do the same. Having and being Battle Buddies is a vital part of readiness planning. 

Make sure this organization will be the right Buddy for you! Please visit ArtsReady's Battle Buddy Network to see their profile.

Then, contact the requesting organization's ArtsReady administrator to discuss the relationship and how you can help each other with business continuity after an emergency.

<%= @requesting_organization.contact_name %>
<%= @requesting_organization.email %>

Happy Planning-
The ArtsReady Team

Keep your doors open. No matter what.
