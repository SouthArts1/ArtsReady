Dear <%= @user.name %>

<%= @requesting_organization.name %> would like to become Battle Buddies with your organization, <%= @target_organization.name %>.

Becoming Battle Buddies means that both organizations agree to help each other, however possible, should either of you experience a crisis. If called upon by a Buddy, your organization can offer up resources, act as a proxy representative, and share select internal documents through the ArtsReady Critical Stuff feature. You can then expect your Buddy to do the same. Having and being Battle Buddies is a vital part of readiness planning. <%= link_to "Learn more about being a Battle Buddy.", root_url %> 

Make sure this organization will be the right Buddy for you! Please log into ArtsReady’s Battle Buddy Network to see their profile.

Then contact Requesting Organization’s ArtsReady administrator to discuss the relationship and how you can help each other with business continuity after an emergency.
