Dear <%= @user.name %>,

You were assigned an important To-Do item in ArtsReady to help organization prepare for the unexpected. We’ve noticed that the task is due, yet it is still designated as “status that is other than complete.”

Your assignment: <%= @todo.description %>
Due: <%= @todo.due_on %>

<%= link_to "Please log in to see what else is required to complete the task.", @url %>

This vital contribution will help organization stay on track to achieve its readiness goals, and your efforts are appreciated. If you have any questions, please contact organization’s ArtsReady administrator, <%= @user.organization.users.first.name %>, <%= @user.organization.users.first.email %>.

Happy Planning-
The ArtsReady Team

Keep your doors open. No matter what.
