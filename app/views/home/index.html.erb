      <blockquote>
        <p>"Although we donâ€™t like to admit it, the arts community is especially vulnerable to crisis. The unforeseen disaster threatens our work and the viability of our agencies. Readiness planning isn't simply a good thing to do, it's a critical action. With ArtsReady, a tool designed by and for the arts community, we make our organizations and field more sustainable and resilient."</p>
