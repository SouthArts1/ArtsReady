      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "Americans for the Arts members are community cornerstones
          across our country, but an unforeseen crisis could cripple
          their organization, or the artists and groups they serve.
          I urge them to join the readiness movement and join ArtsReady.
          Survive and thrive with the help of this sustainability tool."
