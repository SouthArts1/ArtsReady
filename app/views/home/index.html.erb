      <h3>Why does Dance/USA support ArtsReady?</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "Hurricane Sandy was devastating for many dance companies and
          theaters â€“ lost rehearsal time, cancelled shows, destroyed offices,
          damaged sets, costumes and archival materials, and lost income.
          ArtsReady provides a critical resource for arts organizations in
          both planning how to rebound from crises, large or small, and also
          offering aid through the Battle Buddy network. We are thrilled to
          be a Partner with ArtsReady and provide this valuable service to
          Dance/USA members."
