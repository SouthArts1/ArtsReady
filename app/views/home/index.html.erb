      <h3>Why does the South Carolina Arts Commission value ArtsReady?</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"When we used ArtsReady to 'declare an emergency,' we saw first-hand the benefits of immediately connecting to the Battle Buddy Network of like-minded groups ready and willing to help and offer encouragement. As we dig more deeply into the planning tool, we continue to see the power ArtsReady's platform as it helps us become more prepared to respond to and recover from the next unforeseen event."</p>
        - Ken May, Executive Director
