It became obvious that we in the nonprofit arts sector did not have the training or knowledge to help rebound from emergencies. South Arts began research into business continuity and, with funding from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and assistance from the University of California/Berkeley IT and Continuity staff and the Mississippi Arts Commission, developed the prototype of a readiness planning tool. Working with continuity experts and arts organizations who had experienced crises, we shifted the ArtsReady principles away from disasters and toward any type/size of crisis that would interrupt an arts organization’s business; away from specific emergency plans to the concept of “all hazards planning”; and considered the entire range of critical functions that an arts organization needs to keep going in order to operate successfully. Additional support from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts has made the development of the online tool possible. The ArtsReady platform has been built as an open-source tool; it also has been and will continue to be “community-designed,” informed throughout by those who will use the tool.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the ArtsReady platform and website, South Arts co-chairs the National Coalition on Arts’ Preparedness and Emergency Response, which works to encourage readiness planning by arts organizations and individual artists; to connect those impacted with response and recovery resources; to develop tools and networks to help Arts Responders be more effective; and to advocate for public policies that ensure artists and arts organizations have access to emergency resources. South Arts also maintains its Emergency Relief Fund, supported by contributions from the Henry Morrison Flagler Museum, individuals and others to provide emergency assistance to artists and arts organizations in our region.\r\n\r\n<a href=http://artsready.heroku.com/page/staff>Learn About the ArtsReady Team</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=http://artsreay.heroku.com/page/contact>Contact Us</a>','2011-08-22 13:17:13','2011-09-09 13:05:47'),(2,'About the ArtsReady Team','staff','<a href=mailto:mlakinhayes@southarts.org>Mollie Lakin-Hayes</a>, ArtsReady Director\r\nMollie led the development of ArtsReady with former team member Hannah Leatherbury shortly after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

We know that arts managers and artists likely don\'t have training in business continuity or crisis planning. ArtsReady has taken the best ideas from continuity experts and arts workers who have lived/worked through crises to develop this easy-to-use planning tool.  \r\n\r\nTo achieve these plans ArtsReady guides Premium Member organizations through 4 basic steps...\r\n\r\n*_Assess_*   --In an hour or less a high-level member of your organization will go through a series of readiness statements. In reading the statements she will decide how prepared your organization is in relation to the statement and how important it is to your organization. The assessment runs through _key critical functions_ for an arts organization. From people resources, to grantmaking, to technology, to performances. You decide what is included based on what your organization does!\r\n\r\n_*To-Do List*_   --From the Assessment, ArtsReady automatically produces a To-Do list to get your organization\'s preparedness plan in gear. From here your planning can be self-paced to work within your organization\'s time table. You are able to assign the To-Dos to members of your staff, set deadlines and track progress for each item. Those assigned tasks will receive notification from the system and reminders when the task is due for completion. Some To-Do tasks will even automatically prompt your organization to update key items and files on an annual or semi-annual basis!\r\n\r\n_*Critical Stuff*_   --Many To-Do items will suggest that your organization upload files into its Critical Stuff section. Similar to a virtual safety deposit box, Critical Stuff is ultra-secure cloud based storage designed to hold your most vital organizational files. From insurance policies to passwords to contact lists, everything you may need in the event of an emergency will be available to you from any internet-based device anywhere, anytime. Plus, thanks to the reminders set by the To-do function, you\'ll always know that those files are as up-to-date as possible!\r\n\r\n_*Battle Buddy Network*_   --When a crisis hits, all of us could use a hand. That\'s what the Battle Buddy Network is for. During calm times ArtsReady guides you through developing relationships with sister organizations so you can respond to each other in times of need. Then, when a problem does arise, you use ArtsReady to make a distress call, notifying these Battle Buddies and informing them of your problem. You can list resources you need and track your issue through a Crisis Console so the story is told once and your Buddies can spring into action on your behalf. If your Buddy is in crisis you can respond to them through the Lend a Hand feature, offering your own resources and help as needed.','2011-08-22 13:17:13','2011-09-12 21:52:44'),(4,'Frequently Asked Questions','faq','_*What is Readiness Planning?*_\r\n\r\nCreating your Readiness Plan means making decisions before a crisis hits about how you will respond, and collecting before a crisis all of the information and documents that you will need to respond and get your business operations back up and running. There is no one correct design for a Readiness Plan, since you need to address the particular size, assets, activities and risks for your own organization in your own particular environment. \r\n\r\nYour Readiness Plan should be a combination of documents, processes, and training that formulate what your organization will do should the unexpected occur. The ArtsReady system and/or community can help guide you through creating such a plan. You may ultimately have a singular document, or you may have a brief outline that guides key staff and volunteers through emergency operating procedures for your organization, and leads them to any additional information or documents they\'ll need. Design the plan so it meets your organization\'s unique scale and activities. It should be practicle but thorough, so it can actually be deployed in any crisis. Any documents or files needed for your Readiness Plan should be maintained as both on- and off-site hard copies, and there should be an accessible electronic version that is stored securely, and backed up off-site (internet-based cloud storage is ideal, like the <a href=http://artsready.heroku.com/page/tour>ArtsReady Critical Stuff</a> feature).\r\n\r\nA Readiness Plan focuses on your business functions. Your Plan should be “all-hazards” – because any crisis, interruption or emergency involves the loss or unavailability of resources. Whether you experience a theft, major illness, natural disaster or other unexpected event, the crisis is the loss of resources.\r\n\r\n*_How can ArtsReady help make a Readiness Plan?_*\r\n\r\nArtsReady is a web based emergency preparedness platform designed to provide arts organizations with customized business continuity plans for post crisis sustainability. We know that arts managers and artists likely don\'t have training in crisis planning, and it takes time to learn. ArtsReady takes the leg work out of planning for you.

Those critical functions are:\r\n\r\n*People Resources* --The staff, volunteers, members, and visitors of the organization.\r\n*Technology* --The computers, data storage, internet and software you use everyday.\r\n*Finances & Insurance* --The funds and your coverage, and how they are accessed.\r\n*Productions* --The shows and events created at or presented by your organization.\r\n*Ticketing & Messaging* --The box office, public communication, and sales to your public.\r\n*Facilities* --The space, rented or owned, where your organization is located or holds its activities.\r\n*Programs* --The classes, workshops, and projects of your organization and their priority.\r\n*Grantmaking* --The funding sources, the awardees, and the way your grant program works.\r\n*Exhibits* --The inventory, the transport, and the handling of the precious objects you facilitate for display.\r\n\r\nThe first three functions are mandatory for each organization. The remaining are optional depending on the type of organization being considered. Though the ArtsReady program is malleable and generalist, it was designed primarily for presenting and producing organizations that provide public programming, including but not limited to performances, exhibitions, readings, screenings, festivals, and workshops.\r\n\r\n______\r\n\r\nh2.

Most of the To-Dos will get assigned to your organization after the assessment. However, one To-Do is mandatory and must be addressed right away! *We require each organization to add _at least_ one additional ArtsReady team member.* This is in case the primary account holder becomes unavailable. Please be sure to add a second user immediately or risk having your account frozen.\r\n\r\nTo add additional team members:\r\n# Go to Settings using the button on the top right\r\n# Under *My Info* select \"Our Team\"\r\n# In the field at the bottom fill in the first name, last name, and email address for your team member.\r\n# Hit the green \"Add\" button\r\n# The new team member will get an automatic email welcoming them to ArtsReady.\r\n\r\n*STEP 3: Join the Battle Buddy Network*\r\nThe Battle Buddy Network will help you create reciprocal relationships with other arts organizations in ArtsReady to help each other in times of crisis. Joining the Network is fast, easy and vital to truly creating a readiness plan. On the right side of the Dashboard you will see a red link \"Join the Battle Buddy Network.\" Click the link! This will lead you to your Settings (also visible on the top right of the screen), and *My Info*. You will be under the tab \"Organization.\" Select the checkbox at the bottom of the profile to join Battle Buddies.\r\n\r\nh3. After the Set Up and First Time\r\n\r\nYour Dashboard will provide a snapshot of everything ArtsReady. \r\n\r\nIn the information bar on the right you can: \r\n* Access your *Crisis Mode* button\r\n* See the progress bars letting you know how far along you are in your Assessment and To-Do items\r\n* See if anyone has declared a crisis; or, if everything is all right, you\'ll see \"All ArtsReady members are doing great!\"\r\n* Find a link to the latest Featured Library article\r\n\r\nIn the center you will see:\r\n* \"Our Most Urgent To-Dos\" listing to-do items that are due. To learn more about the item presented on the Dashboard, click on its hyperlink.\r\n* Critical Stuff shortcuts\r\n \r\nAbove the navigation tabs, you will find *Settings* which allows you to control various aspects of your organization\'s set up. After your mandatory second user, we encourage to add additional members to your ArtsReady team (up to ten). You will notice a variety of levels within the security clearances.\r\n\r\n| Manager | Can access, change, and control all aspects of your ArtsReady account and its articles |\r\n| Executive | Can assign To- Do items and view all articles related to your ArtsReady account but cannot alter team memberships |\r\n| Editor | Can view and alter Private articles related to your ArtsReady account but can not view Executive* level articles |\r\n| Reader | Can read but not alter Private* articles only |\r\n\r\n*To learn about the different article levels please see the Library and Critical Stuff section. All team members can view, alter and comment upon Public articles.\r\n\r\n__________________\r\n\r\nh2. Assessment\r\n\r\nh3. Beginning your Assessment\r\n\r\nThe Assessment was designed to analyze your level of readiness for each of the critical functions of your organization. Each statement will guide you into considering how a certain element affects what you do and how vital it is to the overall workings of your business. By thinking about each aspect of your critical functions, your organization can determine what needs to be better protected should the unexpected arise.\r\n\r\nThe Assessment should be completed by a high level member of the organization who understands each part of what you do (like the Director, President, or CEO).\r\n\r\nIt should only take an hour, ideally completed in one sitting. \r\n\r\nh3. The Assessment in Progress\r\n\r\nYou are prompted to consider the preparedness level of each element and its priority to your organization. If you would like more clarification the “Learn more about this topic” tab to the right offers an explanation.\r\n\r\n| *The Preparedness choices are:* |\r\n\r\n| *Ready* | Select ready if the statement is true, and you are sure the item is up-to-date. |\r\n| *Not ready* | This means that the item has not been considered or safeguarded. |\r\n| *Needs work* | This option is ideal if you have taken some steps to toward achieving the statement, but the plans you\'ve made could use updating or revisiting. |\r\n| *Unknown* | Choose unknown if you aren\'t sure what the statement is asking, or if you truly don\'t know your readiness status. You\'ll be able to study the topic to learn more and decide its importance to your organization later when you see this item on your To-Do list. |\r\n\r\n| *The Priority levels are:* |\r\n\r\n| *Critical* | This means that the statement relates to something vital to what you do. |\r\n| *Non-critical* | The statement may relate to a necessary part of your functioning, but it is not completely vital to your organization. |\r\n,\r\n\r\nIf the statement is irrelevant to your organization or not important, choose “not applicable” to the left. If the entire section of statements does not apply you can uncheck the box at the top of the section to remove all of them from your list. To revisit a statement, select the “reconsider” button after it has been grayed out.\r\n\r\nAs you complete the Assessment the ArtsReady system will automatically create a To-Do list for your organization, so you can create your readiness plan. As you are running through the statements, if you think of something that we missed, you can add your own To-Do or note at the bottom of each section. Type your idea under \"Add another Item.\" You can sort the item based on the Critical Function it relates to. To learn more about the other fields for \"Add another item\" read the section titled _To Do List_.\r\n\r\nh3. After the Assessment\r\n\r\nYou are ready to start looking over your To-Do List and assigning tasks to your ArtsReady team (remember to visit you Settings to add or update members as needed). \r\n\r\nAnnually the ArtsReady system will automatically prompt you to revisit the Assessment to make sure nothing has changed within your organization, gotten outdated, or has since has added to the Assessment by the greater ArtsReady community. The prompt will come in the form of a To-Do item assigned to you!\r\n\r\n_Still have questions? Contact <a href=\"mail to: admin@artsready.org\">admin@artsready.org</a>_\r\n\r\n______\r\n\r\nh2. To-Do List\r\n\r\nThe To-Do List is a series of tasks that you or the ArtsReady system has created that must be preformed to develop and maintain your organization\'s fully comprehensive and customized readiness plan. \r\n\r\nh3. To-Do Items from the Assessment\r\n\r\nThe majority of your To-Do List comes from your Assessment. The ArtsReady system auto-populates the List based on your responses to the statements. Once the Assessment has been completed you can put readiness planning onto a timeline that makes sense for your organization. Depending on how you answer the Assessment items in the To-Do List will port over with varying statuses and priority levels. Some Assessment items create multiple To-Do items. You can change the Priority accordingly but the Status can only be changed by addressing and completing the task. To-Do items are sorted by Critical Function corresponding to its Assessment origin.\r\n\r\n*STATUS*\r\n*Completed* --You answered that this statement in the Assessment was true and the corresponding To-Do item did not need to be addressed. We do recommend that you check the item though to see if you should upload an article to your Critical Stuff.\r\n*In Progress* --Your organization indicated that the item needs work.\r\n*Not Started* --The item has yet to be addressed or considered. This is also the status for items that were \"unknown.\"\r\n\r\n*PRIORITY*\r\n*Critical*  --The item is vital to your organization\'s readiness plan.\r\n*Not Critical* --The item is important but not critical to your organization.\r\n\r\nh3. _Your_ To-Do Items\r\n\r\nAs you are performing the Assessment or when you are considering your To-Do List, you may think of something vital or specific to your organization that must be taken care of as part of your custom readiness plan. At the bottom of each Assessment section and at the bottom of the To-Do List, you will see the blank bar \"Add an Item\". There you can write yourself a new item. Then you can assign, sort, and label accordingly.\r\n\r\nh3. Recurring and Automatic To-Dos\r\n\r\nCertain To-Do items are automatic to the ArtsReady system because they are universally important. Two key automatic To-Dos are:\r\n\r\n# *Adding a second user* --Each organization must have _at least_ two ArtsReady team members. This To-Do must be performed as one of the initial parts of your set up in ArtsReady.\r\n# *Re-Assessment* --Annually a To-Do item will crop up prompting your organization to re-do its Assessment to make sure nothing has changed.\r\n\r\nOther items on the To-Do list are given \"expiration dates\" to ensure tasks are annually, or in some cases bi-annually, revisited and updated. Examples of such To-Dos are updating the phone tree, meeting with an insurance agent or broker, or renewing CPR and First Aid training. By prompting your organization automatically the ArtsReady system makes sure that your organization will always be in a posture of readiness, and that no aspect of your plan will be forgotten or become out-dated.\r\n\r\nh3. Assigning To-Do Items to your Team\r\n\r\nEach item in the To-Do list should be assigned to a member of your organization\'s ArtsReady team and given a due date. Once that is established the assigned team member will get an automatic email notifying them of the assigned task. Then, if the item hasn\'t been completed at the due date, the member will get a reminder of the task from the system \r\n\r\nTo select a team member select from the drop down list under \"Assigned to.\" This list is populated by the ArtsReady team members that have been entered for your organization under its \"Settings.\" Then choose the due date on the calendar. Once your selections have been made, hit the \"Update\" button.\r\n\r\nh3. The To-Do Detail Page\r\n\r\nWhen, as the assigned team member, you are ready to address the To-Do item, you can log into the system, go to the To-Do page and select the red \"Detail\" button beside it. That will lead you to the To-Do\'s Detail page. You will see all of the information related to the task at hand including to whom it is assigned, when it is due, its status, and when it was last reviewed.\r\n\r\nThere you can link Related Articles to the item either from the Library as a reference (like linking an article about protecting paper artifacts for a To-Do about protecting your exhibit items), or the article can be something from your Critical Stuff that is directly related to the plan (like a pdf of your flood insurance policy for your To-Do about access to insurance policies). Some Articles may already be present to help guide you through the item. This is when you can research statements from the Assessment that you were unsure about by reading articles, viewing examples, and finding tips associated with the resulting T-Do.\r\n\r\nTo indicate your progress on the To-Do item and what steps were taken to take care of the assignment, log a note about the To-Do.\r\n\r\nWhen you have completed your changes hit \"Save note.\"\r\n\r\n_Still have questions? Contact <a href=\"mail to: admin@artsready.org\">admin@artsready.org</a>_\r\n\r\n______________\r\n\r\nh2. Critical Stuff and Premium Member Library\r\n\r\nh3. Library\r\n\r\nThe Library is a vast resource of articles related to readiness and recovery. Articles within the Library can be Public (viewable to the entire ArtsReady community, Premium and Basic Members alike), or Private (only viewable to your organization). Premium Members are able to upload articles to the Library and comment on the Public submissions of others. Basic Members can view Public submissions to learn about business continuity and help with their own readiness planning.\r\n\r\nh3. Critical Stuff\r\n\r\nOften as you are completing an item on your To-Do list, you will be prompted to upload an article to your Critical Stuff. Critical Stuff is like your safety deposit box. It is where your most vital articles that you may need in an emergency go so you will always know where they are, and you can access them at anytime from any internet-ready device. This is a key component to achieving organizational readiness.\r\n\r\nh3. Uploading Articles\r\n\r\nWhen you are uploading an article to ArtsReady, you are required to you provide a title, and short description of the item. You will also be asked to select a _Critical Function_ which will allow the article to be searchable and sorted related to the key elements for arts organizations. You may also assign tags related to the subject the article addresses for more specific searches.\r\n\r\nArticles can be files uploaded from your hard drive, like a pdf of your insurance policy, a doc of your communication plan, or a jpg of your facility. An article can also be a select url link that, for example, leads to your board list on your website or provides access to your online database. Or you can make an article by typing text directly into the provided body field. This kind of article may be useful if you want to make a quick listing or set of instructions (like writing out your serial numbers for your software or the contact information for the best maintenance crew in your area). Direct text can be formatted with <a href=http://textile.thresholdstate.com/>textile syntax</a> or basic html. You can also use the large body field to describe an article with an associated file and/or link.\r\n\r\nWhen uploading articles you have several options and levels of security that you can select.\r\n\r\n| *PUBLIC* | Viewable to the whole ArtsReady Community in the Library | Premium Members are welcome to comment these |\r\n| *PRIVATE* | In the Library but viewable only to your organization |  Available to all of your ArtsReady team members |\r\n| *EXECUTIVE FILES* | A step above Private articles; viewable only to Managers and those with Executive privileges on your ArtsReady team | Reserved for sensitive files that should only be viewed by top staff at your organization |\r\n\'\r\n\r\nh4. Sharing within your Battle Buddy Network\r\n\r\nOnce you have established your organizational Battle Buddy Network you may want to share articles with select sister organizations in advance of or during a crisis. This is so your Battle Buddy can act as your proxy should you need outside assistance. Examples of items you may want to share are contact lists or communication plans, so the Battle Buddy can speak on behalf of your organization if called upon to do so. Choosing \"All Battle Buddies\" allows your entire Network the ability to access the document. Using \"Specific Battle Buddies\" lets you choose from your list of Buddies.\r\n\r\nBe sure to communicate with your Battle Buddy about the document you have shared and what its purpose is in your readiness plan, so your Buddy is adequately prepared to assist you if needed. The Buddy will be able to read the item, but will not have editing abilities.\r\n\r\nh4. Including an Article in Critical Stuff\r\n\r\nCritical Stuff should be reserved for your most vital files so they can be accessed easily and quickly. If you are uploading a renewed copy of a key item, we recommend that you edit the old version rather than uploading a new one to avoid confusing duplicate copies. Maintaining a clean and easliy accessible listing will make your response to the unexpected faster and smoother.\r\n\r\nh4. Assigning an Article to a To-Do Item\r\n\r\nArticles can also be assigned to pertinent To-Do items for your organization. The article could be a reference for the person assigned to the task, like an article about cloud storage from the Public Library for a To-Do task related to backing up your servers. It could also be specific to the task itself, like linking your organizational chart to the To-Do that discusses organizational charts. Articles assigned in this manner will be visible on the appropriate To-Do\'s detail page.\r\n\r\n*NOTICE: Both the Library and Critical Stuff  features of ArtsReady were designed to promote preparedness and help develop your organizational plan. They are _not_ for a backup of all of your digital files. The Technology section will guide you through setting up such full system backups. Those abusing the Library or Critical Stuff features will be in breach of contract and may lose ArtsReady privileges without refund, notification, or re-entry ability. Please review our <a href=http://artsready.heroku.com>Terms of Use</a> for more information.*\r\n\r\n_Still have questions? Contact <a href=\"mail to: admin@artsready.org\">admin@artsready.org</a>._\r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\nh2. Battle Buddies\r\n\r\nThe Battle Buddy Network was designed to help arts organizations make connections with one another in times of calm, so when trouble strikes you can immediately turn to one another for help. The relationship between Battle Buddies should be one of trust, adequate communication, and mutual respect. Joining the Battle Buddies when you begin your ArtsReady journey is only a partial step toward truly engaging with the Network. The rest requires research so you can find a Buddy that will help you in your more vulnerable areas, and outreach so you can establish a relationship. This is the most advanced part of ArtsReady but can be the most rewarding and maybe even most vital.\r\n\r\nh3. Building \"Our Profile\"\r\n\r\nWhen you first visit the Battle Buddy Network you will see 3 tabs: Lend a Hand, Find a Buddy, and Our Profile. A fourth tab, Crisis Console, is only visible if you have activated the Crisis Mode in ArtsReady.\r\n\r\nh3. Find a Buddy: Building a Network\r\n\r\n*Finding a Buddy*\r\nArtsReady recommends that organizations seek multiple Battle Buddies with a minimum of two--one within your region and one out of your region in case a large scale disaster hits. \r\n\r\nIn looking for a Buddy you should consider what may be useful to you and your Critical Functions if your organization is compromised. Remember that a Buddy may not be directly within your arts discipline! Some things that a Buddy may help with...\r\n* Sending extra hands if you need help with a clean up, set up, or move\r\n* Communicating on your behalf if you are incapacitated organizationally\r\n* Providing back up office, rehearsal, or production space\r\n* Assisting with technical expertise (like loaning an accountant, lighting tech, maintenance person, etc)\r\n* Giving you a gathering space if you can\'t get to your typical facility.\r\n\r\nLook at the potential Buddy\'s profile in ArtsReady and/or research their organization externally by visiting websites or reading about them to gather more information. Once you have chosen a Buddy to approach you can hit the \"Add a Buddy\" button. The system will send the organization an automated note stating your request.\r\n\r\n*A Buddy Invitation to you!*\r\nYou have received an email from an organization requesting Battle Buddy status. We highly recommend that you research the requestor before you commit. The research should not be unlike that you perform to find Buddies. Remember, Battle Buddy relationships must be mutual. By becoming a Buddy you agree to help and be helped by one another. Do not feel obligated to accept a request if the organization would not be a suitable match.\r\n\r\nHowever if you research the Buddy and find the relationship appropriate, proceed accordingly and become Battle Buddies!\r\n\r\n*Now that you\'re Buddies*\r\nIt\'s great to have friends! Now you want to communicate with your Buddy so you can define the parameters of the relationship and what role you are interested in playing for each other in times of need. The agreement can be to reciprocate on specific needs/resources, or can be an overall organizational agreement, but each Buddy should clearly understand their commitment and formally agree.\r\n\r\nOnce you\'ve established a Battle Buddy relationship you can:\r\n* Notify your Buddies specifically and solely when you declare a crisis if you wish to keep your issue private\r\n* Share internal documents with your Buddies if something specific is needed to help you out.\r\n\r\n*Contracting with a Buddy*\r\nArtsReady does not facilitate contracts between Battle Buddies, but you may find an agreement in writing useful for clarifying expectations. We encourage establishing the relationship in the clearest and most thoughtful manner possible. \r\n\r\nNOTE: Battle Buddy relationships are and always will be based on good faith only. ArtsReady reserves the right to suspend or discontinue accounts of users who would use the Network relationships for payment or profit.\r\n\r\nh3. Lend a Hand: Helping someone out\r\n\r\n(To navigate this section it may be useful to read the section below \"Declaring a Crisis\".)\r\n\r\n*A Battle Buddy in Trouble!*\r\nIf a Battle Buddy declares a Crisis* you will receive an automatic email from ArtsReady alerting you and stating the most recent entry on their Crisis Console so you know what the problem is. From there you can log in to ArtsReady and go to the Lend a Hand page to offer your available resources and offer assistance. You can also contact them directly because the same email will list the organization\'s primary contact person (but keep in mind though that the full ArtsReady team for the organization in troubled will see your response in ArtsReady).\r\n\r\nAs the situation progresses, you will receive follow-up email alerts each time the Buddy updates the Console. You will also recieve an email notification when the Crisis is resolved and has been closed out.\r\n\r\n*This excludes Private Crisis declarations that didn\'t include you. However, your Buddy may elect to alert you of their Private Crisis after it has already been underway. You will receive a notice then and be able to see the backlog of the Crisis Console.\r\n\r\n*A Crisis from a Non-Buddy*\r\nWhen another organization declares a public crisis, you will see the issue on the Lend a Hand page and your Dashboard, even if you aren\'t Battle Buddies. You can read about the organization\'s crisis and offer help if appropriate. First suggest becoming Battle Buddies and, if they accept, you\'ll be able to offer resources and respond through their Crisis Console.\r\n\r\nh3. Crisis Console\r\n\r\nYour Crisis Console is only visible when you activate the Crisis Mode. Please see the section on Declaring a Crisis to learn more about how it works.\r\n\r\n_Still have questions? Contact <a href=\"mail to: admin@artsready.org\">admin@artsready.org</a>._\r\n\r\n____________\r\n\r\nh2. Declaring a Crisis\r\n\r\nDespite our focus on preparing for the worst, we hope you will never have to use this feature. However, at ArtsReady we know that the unexpected does happen more often than we\'d like! A crisis is any unforeseen event that is causing a temporary disruption to one, some, or all of your critical functions. Examples of a crisis may be: sudden loss of key staff, theft, natural disaster, loss of access to your facility, a technological crash, and so on.\r\n\r\nIf you have to declare a crisis, you will find the red and grey *Crisis Mode* button on your Dashboard and on the Battle Buddy Network. Before activated, Crisis Mode the button will say \"OFF\". Once you have declared a crisis the button will say \"ON.\"\r\n\r\nWhen you hit the button to declare your crisis you will first need to write a brief explanation of your problem in the \"Description\" window to tell the community what is going on. (Example: A water main busted and flooded our prop storage) Then you will  need to consider _who_ you want to notify about your crisis. There are three options:\r\n\r\nbq. *Public*--Your crisis will be visible to the entire ArtsReady Premium Member community on their Dashboards, and through _Lend a Hand_ in the Battle Buddy Network. Organizations outside of your network can offer to become your Battle Buddy* and help you. Your pre-established Battle Buddies will receive an email notification as well. \r\n*All Battle Buddies* --Your crisis will only be visible to your established Battle Buddies. They will also receive an email notification, see it on their Dashboards, and will be able to respond to you and offer aid through _Lend a Hand_ in the Battle Buddy Network.\r\n*Private/ Specific Battle Buddies* --With this option you can select which of your Battle Buddies you notify of the crisis. Only those selceted will receive an email notification. This is designed for more sensitive issues.\r\n\r\nEmail communications that go out to your Battle Buddies will include your crisis description, and the primary contact information for your organization. You can view or edit your primary contact information under \"Settings.\"\r\n\r\nOnce you have chosen your crisis level and described your issue, you hit the red \"Declare Crisis\" button and the ArtsReady system is put into motion for you! To cancel out of the page and not declare a crisis, select the \"Cancel\".\r\n\r\n*Becoming Battle Buddies should involve research into the requesting organization since it requires a bit of commitment. If possible we recommend having a proxy vet Battle Buddy requests for you while you are dealing with your Crisis. The proxy can be another pre-established Battle Buddy, your subsidizing ArtsReady Partner, or a service organization who also works in ArtsReady.\r\n\r\nh3. Crisis Console\r\n\r\nAfter you declare your crisis, and as long as your organization remains in crisis you will have access to a Crisis Console. The Console is visible immediately upon going into crisis mode, can be accessed through your Battle Buddy Network (exclusively), and will appear upon log in in lieu of your Dashboard. On the Console you can log updates about your problem and list resources you need. Each time you log an update a message will go out to the Buddies you have involved in your issue. They in turn can offer help to you and respond to your crisis through thier _Lend a Hand_ page in the Battle Buddy Network.\r\n\r\nIf you are in a Private Crisis, you can also invite in Buddies that were previously excluded. Do so by hitting the Crisis Mode button again and selecting the additional Buddy. That Buddy will receive a notification email and when they log into the system the will see your whole Crisis log on thier _Lend a Hand_.\r\n\r\nh3. Concluding the Crisis\r\n\r\nHooray! Your problem was resolved in no time with a little help from your friends (or so we hope). You are ready to announce your recovery. To do so you are welcome to send a concluding message to the field through the message log. Then on the bottom of the Crisis Console you can hit the button ending the crisis. Everyone involved will receive a notice on your behalf from the ArtsReady system saying that the issue was resolved.\r\n\r\nA backlog of your resolved crises can be found under your Settings in a tab called “Previous Crises” indefinitely for your review or reference. This tab only appears if you\'ve expirienced a crisis and used ArtsReady to help during it. \r\n\r\n_Still have questions?
